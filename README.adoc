= Documentation Toolchain


== Goals
Manage conversions between text written in ADOC and JSON representations of that content with DOCBOOK as an intermediary. 

Use ADOC or other DSL to write articles that are consistent with DOCBOOK standard.
 
* Convert ADOC to DOCBOOK
* Convert DOCBOOK to JSON
* Convert DOCBOOK to PDF
* Convert DOCBOOK.JSON to CMS.JSON

== Ideas

* Use gulp?
* Identify all libraries
* Use DOCBOOK as document database?
* Choose XML to JSON package: xml2js, xml-js, cheerio
